# Artifical-Dataset-For-Faces
Creating an artificial dataset using Stable Diffusion for different emotions on human faces (which can be further be utilized for sentiment analysis)  
## Introduction:
The Stable Diffusion technique is utilized to generate synthetic images depicting various human emotions. This artificial dataset aims to aid in sentiment analysis research by providing diverse facial expressions for training and evaluation purposes. Here, it is showm how to create human faces of various types to be cataloged into 4 emotions.    

## Diffusers
Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether one is looking for a simple inference solution or want to train their own diffusion model, Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. The library is designed with a focus on usability over performance, simple over easy, and customizability over abstractions.

The library has three main components:

State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines for inference with just a few lines of code.  
Interchangeable noise schedulers for balancing trade-offs between generation speed and quality.  
Pretrained models that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems.  
## Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises synthetic images representing different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger and surprise. Each image is labelled and categorized into its  respective folder according to the prompts it was made to be used.  
## Dataset Usage:
Researchers and practitioners can employ this dataset for emotion recognition and sentiment analysis tasks. By training machine learning models on this diverse dataset, accurate emotion detection systems can be developed.
